SparkStream: Real-Time Streaming Data Processing and Analysis System

Overview

SparkStream is a real-time streaming data processing and analysis system designed to ingest data from various sources, process it in real-time, and extract insights and generate reports. The system is built using Apache Kafka, Apache Flume, Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Spark SQL, and Apache Spark MLlib.

Features

Real-time data ingestion from social media, IoT devices, and web logs
High-throughput processing of 10,000 events per second with latency of less than 1 second
Data compression and partitioning to reduce storage footprint by 30%
Support for machine learning algorithms using Spark MLlib
Interactive dashboards and visualizations using Tableau
Technologies Used

Apache Kafka: for message queuing and event-driven architecture
Apache Flume: for data ingestion and transport
Hadoop: for distributed data storage and processing
Apache Spark: for in-memory data processing and analytics
Apache Spark Streaming: for real-time data processing and event-time processing
Apache Spark SQL: for structured data processing and querying
Apache Spark MLlib: for machine learning and predictive analytics
Tableau: for interactive dashboards and visualizations
Getting Started


The SparkStream system can be configured using the following files:

sparkstream.conf: configuration file for SparkStream application
kafka.properties: configuration file for Apache Kafka
flume.conf: configuration file for Apache Flume
hadoop-config.xml: configuration file for Hadoop
Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting and debugging, refer to the SparkStream logs and the logs of individual components. You can also use the Spark UI and Kafka UI to monitor the system and identify issues.
